	"overview": "Initially developed for text-to-win promotions in NFL stadiums, this system evolved over the course of a year to manage 10 different contest types at almost 200 Verizon-sponsored events. The application features a permission structure with eight different user levels, and a UI to support the specific workflows of each. In addition to standard CMS controls, the system also includes multiple game interface views developed for customer gameplay on large touch screens.",
